# Heart-Disease-Prediction Using Machine Learning-(Supervised Learning)
In contemporary healthcare, preventing heart disease has emerged as a critical imperative. The advent of data-driven systems revolutionizes the landscape, facilitating predictive models that assess an individual's risk based on multifaceted factors like age, blood pressure, cholesterol levels, and lifestyle habits. Here, Machine Learning (ML) assumes paramount importance, offering robust predictive capabilities for heart diseases with remarkable accuracy.

Within this framework, the classification task delineates whether heart disease is present or absent, harnessing input features spanning a spectrum of parameters. By harnessing the power of Python, these algorithms are implemented, with Scikit-learn serving as a foundational library for ML operations. The project's culmination is a Kaggle kernel titled 'Binary Classification with Sklearn and Keras,' encapsulating the journey of leveraging sophisticated ML techniques to confront one of society's most pressing health challenges: mitigating the prevalence and impact of heart diseases, thus fostering a healthier future for individuals worldwide.
